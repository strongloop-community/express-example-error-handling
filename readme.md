# Asychronous error handling in Express

This repo includes some workable code samples in conjunction with the [StrongLoop article](https://strongloop.com/?p=24465). Generator example requires Node 0.12 or io.js.

## Setup

Clone the repo and run `npm install`.  Then run any of the samples by using npm scripts.

- `npm run promises` - promise based error handling
- `npm run generators` - promise-generator based error handling
- `npm run async-await` - async/await based error handling
